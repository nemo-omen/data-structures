## Data Structures
An exercise in implementing various data structures in different programming languages.

## Languages
Implementing data structures in different programming languageswill, with any luck, improve both by knowledge of data structures and my knowledge of the languages those structures are implemented in.

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- C++
- Java(?)
- Rust(?)
- Go(?)

## The Structures
- Linked list
  - singly linked
  - doubly linked
  - circular
- Stack
- Queue
  - Priority queue
- Heap
- Tree
- Hash table/Symbol table

Where applicable, implementation of the above data structures will avoid using built-in structures of the language. For example: stacks and queues will (hopefully) be implemented without using arrays, and will instead use the language's `iterator` (or similar) functions. This is so I can, with any luck, gain a deeper understanding of how these things work. Also, it'll be harder to do, and who doesn't like a challenge?
