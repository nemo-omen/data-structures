## Data Structures
An exercise in implementing various data structures in different programming languages.

## Languages
Implementing data structures in different programming languageswill, with any luck, improve both by knowledge of data structures and my knowledge of the languages those structures are implemented in.

- JavaScript
- C++
- TypeScript
- Java(?)
- Rust(?)
- Go(?)

## The Structures
- Linked list
  - singly linked
  - doubly linked
  - circular
- Stack
- Queue
  - Priority queue
- Heap
- Tree
- Hash table/Symbol table

Where applicable, implementation of the above data structures will avoid using built-in structures of the language. For example: stacks and queues will (hopefully) be implemented without using arrays, and will instead use the language's `iterator` (or similar) functions. This is so I can, with any luck, gain a deeper understanding of how these things work. Also, it'll be harder to do, and who doesn't like a challenge?

## Approaching the project

I'll probably implement all of the data structures above in one language at a time. I'll also probably start with JavaScript because it's a little simpler than the other languages on the list and I hope to use it professionally in the future.

Following a JavaScript implementation, I'll probably rebuild the structure in C++ because that's the language used to teach almost all of my CS courses. Also, C++ is a damned good language to be familiar with.

Finally, because I'm interested in learning more about it, I'll do a TypeScript implementation. I'll do my best to make anything I do work across environments, but I'll probably do most of the coding in a Deno environment. Why? Because I really don't feel like messing with the setup for Node.
